## ‚ÑπÔ∏è General Information

This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the application‚Äôs data.

The course is worth 5-13 credits, and the content is the same as in the [Full stack course](https://fullstack-hy2020.github.io/) held at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/computer-science) at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2020. There is also an associated [project](https://fullstackopen.com/osa0/yleista#full-stack-harjoitustyo) that is worth 1-10 credits.

Partners and affiliates of the course include [Houston Inc](https://www.houston-inc.com/), [Terveystalo](https://www.terveystalo.com/fi/Yritystietoa/Terveystalo-tyontantajana/Digital-Health/), [Elisa](https://elisa.fi/), [K-ryhm√§](https://www.kesko.fi/), [Unity Technologies](https://www.instagram.com/unitytechnologies/?hl=en) and [Konecranes](https://careers.konecranes.com/Konecranes/).

Exercises are submitted through GitHub and by marking completed exercises in the [submission application](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/fullstackopen).

You may submit all the exercises of this course into the same repository, or use multiple repositories. If you submit exercises of different parts into the same repository, please use a sensible naming scheme for the directories.

One very functional file structure for the submission repository is as follows:

```
part0
part1
  courseinfo
  unicafe
  anecdotes
part2
  phonebook
  countries
```

See this [example submission repository](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/example-submission-repository)!

For each part of the course there is a directory, which further branches into directories containing a series of exercises, like "unicafe" for part 1.

For each web application for a series of exercises, it is recommended to submit all files relating to that application, except for the directory _node_modules_.

The exercises are submitted **one part at a time**. When you have submitted the exercises for a part of the course you can no longer submit undone exercises for the same part.

**Note** that in this part, there are more exercises besides those found below. _Do not submit your work_ until you have completed all of the exercises you want to submit for the part.
