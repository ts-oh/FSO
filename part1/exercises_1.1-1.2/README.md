## Exercises 1.1.-1.2.

**1.1: course information, step1**

_The application that we will start working on in this exercise will be further developed in a few of the following exercises. In this and other upcoming exercise sets in this course, it is enough to only submit the final state of the application. If desired, you may also create a commit for each exercise of the series, but this is entirely optional._

Use create-react-app to initialize a new application. Modify _index.js_ to match the following

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

import App from './App'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)
and App.js to match the following

const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const part1 = 'Fundamentals of React'
  const exercises1 = 10
  const part2 = 'Using props to pass data'
  const exercises2 = 7
  const part3 = 'State of a component'
  const exercises3 = 14

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{course}</h1>
      <p>
        {part1} {exercises1}
      </p>
      <p>
        {part2} {exercises2}
      </p>
      <p>
        {part3} {exercises3}
      </p>
      <p>Number of exercises {exercises1 + exercises2 + exercises3}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App

```

and remove extra files (App.css, App.test.js, index.css, logo.svg, setupTests.js, reportWebVitals.js)).

Unfortunately, the entire application is in the same component. Refactor the code so that it consists of three new components: _Header, Content, and Total_. All data still resides in the _App_ component, which passes the necessary data to each component using props. _Header_ takes care of rendering the name of the course, _Content_ renders the parts and their number of exercises and _Total_ renders the total number of exercises.

Define the new components in file _App.js_.

The _App_ component's body will approximately be as follows:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  // const-definitions

  return (
    <div>
      <Header course={course} />
      <Content ... />
      <Total ... />
    </div>
  )
}
```

**WARNING** create-react-app automatically makes the project a git repository unless the application is created within an already existing repository. Most likely you do not want the project to become a repository, so run the command `rm -rf .git` in the root of the project.

**1.2: course information, step2**

Refactor the Content component so that it does not render any names of parts or their number of exercises by itself. Instead it only renders three Part components of which each renders the name and number of exercises of one part.

```jsx
const Content = ... {
  return (
    <div>
      <Part .../>
      <Part .../>
      <Part .../>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Our application passes on information in quite a primitive way at the moment, since it is based on individual variables. This situation will improve soon.
